Portfolio Template

This is a portfolio template which is completley responsive and mobile friendly. 
It is built using HTML, CSS, JS and SCSS
Main focus was to have a hands on expeience with SCSS and its various features and how using SCSS makes it easy to work with CSS.

This project is an extension of the project made by Traversey Media. 
Here I have included the typing effect on the homepage which is a pure JS without the usage of any external library for providing it.
